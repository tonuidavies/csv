# csv
reading and writing csv files

## Overview
This is a program that takes is data from a csv file detailing loans borrowed through various networks at different dates in form of many different products.
From my point of of understanding, the program is supposed to sort the data and output a file known as Output.csv.
I have included comments in my program so that anyone going through the code will able to understand easily.


## Prerequisites
For this program to run efficiently one should have:
* Python 3.5
* Text editor
* Git

## Usage
In order to run this program make sure you have python 3 installed in your machine or python3 environment activated and clone this repo into the folder you're working from.

` # git clone https://github.com/tonuidavies/csv.git`

Then run csv_file.py by running the following command on your terminal

`# python csv_file.py`

Finally find a newly created Output.csv file in your folder
 
 
 
## Assumptions
 
I have assumed that the program is always expected to read data that the structure will not change for example the date item will always be third value in the csv

## Reasons to use python

* Multi-paradigm. You can write object-oriented and functional code and there was no better way to solve this problem without using OOP
* Python is much easy to use in data processing compared to other languages like Java.
* Compatibility with use of linux terminal also contributed much to the decision.
* Iteration in python is easy as this program expected me to loop through various components.

## Conclusion
The task has been a good challenge for any developer and it has given me a chance to think beyond basic python functions and classes. I can conclude that the task was succesful since the objective was achieved. 
I hope this will change how one will look at similar problems and come up with good solutions to such problems.

Contributors and issues are welcomed.
