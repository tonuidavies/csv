# csv
reading and writing csv files

## Overview
This is a program that takes is data from a csv file detailing loans borrowed through various networks at different dates in form of many different products.
From my point of of understanding, the program is supposed to sort the data and output a file known as Output.csv.
I have included comments in my program so that anyone going through the code will able to understand easily.


## Prerequisites
For this program to run efficiently one should have:
* Python 3.5
* Text editor
* Git

## Usage
In order to run this program make sure you have python 3 installed in your machine or python3 environment activated and clone this repo into the folder you're working from.


 #git clone https://github.com/tonuidavies/csv.git
 
 
 
 ## Assumptions
 
 I have assumed that the program is always expected to read data that the structure will not change for example the date item will always be third value in the csv
